# Local public-preview profile

The dedicated `lemonstudio-development` executable uses **Lemon Studio Public Preview** under the platform's normal application-data folder. This applies to a direct executable launch as well as the Desktop development launcher. An explicit `OPENSTUDIO_USER_DIR` still overrides it. The preview does not migrate a legacy OpenStudio profile. Public executable names retain the normal Lemon Studio profile.

A fresh preview uses the actual embedded Lemon Starter template and normal application defaults. Samples default to this profile's own `Samples` directory; no machine-specific sample drive is guessed. Existing personal sample locations belong in the `browser_samples_root` preference. An empty library says **No samples yet**. Samples, favorites, settings, plugin database, downloaded stem runtime/headphone profiles and AI trust are separate from the personal installation.

On Michael's local Windows installation, the preview is seeded with an empty plugin cache so testing on a producer's computer simulates a new user with no additional plugins. Users can discover their installed plugins with Find new plugins in Settings > Plugins. No sample packs are bundled in the current release payload. Users add their folders themselves.

The profile is persistent after its first launch: subsequent testing can change it. Do not reset it on each launch or delete test projects. Preserve the previous development profile when preparing a fresh first-run preview. Never ship local profiles, private plugin-import files, personal libraries or preview launcher configuration in public packages.

Fresh installations also start with the browser on the left, mixer across the top (about62% of the workspace), and playlist below. The channel rack and piano roll start hidden. Geometry is applied at the first main-window paint so it uses actual display dimensions, including a435px minimum mixer height for720p layouts. Both window heights and their shared divider remain adjustable. A saved mixer or playlist rectangle prevents the first-run arrangement from replacing the user's layout.
