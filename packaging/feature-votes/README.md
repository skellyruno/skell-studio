# Lemon Studio feature voting service

The native browser tab uses https://michaellanemusic.de/lemon-studio/features/api.php.
The voting API and private owner dashboard are deployed independently of DAW installers/feeds.

## User behavior

Everyone can read. Each saved anonymous identity can vote independently on every suggestion. Repeated clicks are idempotent. Switching direction replaces the existing vote. Green selected buttons and a Your vote label show the choice. Suggestions are 8–120 characters. Three starter ideas are seeded with no invented votes. Results are ordered by net score, then newest; the board accepts at most 500 suggestions.

Networking runs on a worker, with an eight-second request timeout, no redirects, bounded JSON responses and minute refreshes only while the tab is visible. Offline uses cached results or starter suggestions, disables submitting/voting, and displays an inline status without modal errors. Draft text stays during the session; it is never automatically submitted later. Searching filters displayed titles.

## Identity and abuse limits

A server-issued 256-bit random bearer token is saved in the active profile's feature-voter.key before a vote is sent (0600 on Unix). Invalid/unreadable identity files fail closed rather than silently creating new identities. Concurrent writes cannot replace an existing identity. Never bundle this file in installers or source. The server stores only its SHA-256 hash, not the token. No hardware fingerprint, email, audio, project contents or plugin list is sent. Optional forum display names and cropped profile thumbnails are public when the member saves them.

SQLite PRIMARY KEY(user,feature) enforces one current vote; BEGIN IMMEDIATE transactions serialize mutations and checks. Server-side limits: 120 requests/minute/IP network; 12 identity challenges/hour; 3 registrations/day/IP network; 40 changed votes/minute/identity; at most 3 new identities voting on the same suggestion/day/IP network; 3 submissions/day/identity and 6/day/IP network. IPv6 shares limits across its /64 network. This can affect shared networks. Creating an identity also requires a short, signed, expiring, IP-bound proof-of-work challenge, consumed once. No private signing secret is shipped in the client.

These are anonymous anti-abuse controls, NOT proof of a unique human. A determined attacker with multiple networks/identities can still manipulate votes. Verified accounts or managed bot challenges would be a future upgrade. Do not claim foolproof protection.

Input is length/type checked, normalized for duplicate titles, and rejects links/control characters/markup. SQL uses bound parameters; the native client renders text, not HTML. The endpoint accepts bounded JSON POST requests, no cookie credentials, and no cross-origin access. Server errors do not expose database paths or internals. Network limits store keyed hashes, not raw addresses; expired rate records are pruned. Standard hosting access logs may still contain IP addresses under the hosting provider's policy.

## Hosting and maintenance

Requires PHP 8.1+ and PDO SQLite. The database and private HMAC secret are created outside DOCUMENT_ROOT in its parent directory's lemon-feature-votes-private/votes.sqlite. It is not part of the downloadable source or app. Back up this directory privately using the host's backup facility; preserve the database across API deployments. The owner dashboard is at features/admin.php. It requires a separate owner password stored as a PHP password_hash in the private database; no credentials are included in the app or source. Do not delete or replace the live database during deployment.

api.php contains reusable core functions. test.php must run against a temporary isolated database, never the production database. It exercises repeat clicks, separate suggestions, direction changes, auth and input rejection, duplicate submissions, quotas, challenge replay and IP voting limits. A deployment can use a temporary unpredictable test path protected by a random request header; remove its files in finally. Upload the new API to a temporary filename then rename, retaining a private previous-code backup. Verify the live read-only list through HTTPS. Do not run registration/vote test traffic against the public board.

## Owner moderation dashboard

Deploy admin.php, admin-core.php, admin.html, admin.js and admin.css alongside api.php. Never deploy test.php/admin-test.php as unprotected public routes. admin.php serves the static login shell; all data and moderation requests require owner authentication. Static UI files carry no secrets. No external JS, fonts, trackers or frameworks are used.

Authentication: random owner password, password_hash/password_verify, regenerated session ID after login, Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite=Strict session cookie, two-hour absolute session expiry, session CSRF token on every POST including login/logout, exact-origin check, bounded JSON requests and eight login attempts per IP per 15 minutes. Deny framing, use strict self-only CSP and no-store responses. Credentials and DB backups must remain outside DOCUMENT_ROOT. Login failures never reveal whether an owner is configured.

Controls: search/sort; hide/restore; close/reopen votes; public Open/Planned/In progress/Completed/Declined labels; paged voter identity review; block/unblock author or voter. Blocks prevent that anonymous identity submitting/voting and exclude its votes across all suggestions; unblocking restores them. Blocks do not hide its suggestions automatically. No destructive-delete button. Audit history is stored in moderation_log; dashboard displays latest 60 actions. Updated native clients show status labels and expandable owner comments (readable from offline cache too). Existing DAW clients remain compatible, display lock/blocked rejections inline and refresh the board normally.

The additive migration preserves existing SQLite tables/data. New columns: features.status/locked and users.blocked. Backup the private database with SQLite VACUUM INTO before deployment, then install files using staging names/renames. First owner provision must happen through trusted hosting administration or a random-header-protected one-use provisioning route, removed in finally. Refuse to overwrite an existing owner password; password resets require trusted hosting access. Do not put provisioning credentials in URLs, public files, Git, source snapshots or console output.

On Michael's Windows PC the Desktop shortcut launches Desktop/Lemon Studio Moderation/Open Dashboard.ps1. It reads a DPAPI-protected SecureString from LOCALAPPDATA/Lemon Studio Moderation/owner-password.xml, copies the password to the clipboard, and opens the HTTPS dashboard. The user pastes it into the login form. No token appears in the shortcut or URL. The private provisioning recovery copy lives in the Mac owner-only release staging folder, never shared source. A different account/computer requires deliberate credential setup. Instructions tell the user to replace clipboard contents after login and sign out when finished.

Verification: original test.php still passes. admin-test.php covers old-schema migration, visibility, locks, statuses, blocked identities/vote exclusion and restoration, audit, voter review, CSRF, expiry and login throttling in an isolated temporary DB. Deployment additionally exercises real HTTP unauthorized access, login, CSRF, foreign Origin, moderation, and logout against a protected temporary route, removing test files/storage afterwards. Production verification is owner login plus read-only board/list, with no fake live votes or moderation. Native clients must update to show public status labels/comments; older versions can vote on Open unlocked suggestions and receive an inline rejection for archived statuses.

Public comments: owner-only add/edit/remove, up to10 comments of600 Unicode characters per suggestion. Comments are plain text, authored as Michael / Lemon Studio, with creation/edit timestamps. Hidden suggestions never expose comments on the public board. Public API has no comment-write action; existing owner authentication and CSRF protect mutations. Additive public_comments table migration preserves votes/identities. Native HTTP response limit16MiB covers the bounded maximum board.


## Community sections and forum (2 November 2026)

The native Community tab defaults to Voting, with Community forum beside it. Open, unlocked ideas stay in Active voting. Planned, In progress, Completed, Rejected (stored as Declined) and manually closed ideas have collapsed, counted sections; their comments and vote history remain readable. The owner dashboard mirrors these groups. Only Open unlocked suggestions accept votes, including from older clients. Status changes reach native clients on the existing visible-tab minute refresh or manual Refresh.

Forum threads have a 4–100 character title and an initial message; messages/replies allow 1–800 characters. Replies retain an explicit parent message ID. Pages contain 20 threads or messages, with Previous/Next. One like/dislike per identity per message; clicking the selected reaction removes it. Pages and session drafts remain readable offline, but writes need a connection and are never queued automatically. Plain text only; links, markup and control characters are rejected. Refreshes run on the existing worker, not audio threads; this is a small paged forum, not live chat with presence or notifications.

Members can set a 2–32 character display name and optional PNG/JPEG profile picture through Profile. The client reads at most 8 MiB, decodes on a worker, center-crops/resamples to 32×32 RGB, and transmits exactly 6,144 hex characters. The server validates that fixed representation: no uploaded executable file, URL fetching, image metadata or image decoder on the server. Initials are used without a picture. A stable public member label stays with all messages; names are display names, not verified identities, and changing names/pictures does not reset votes or blocks. Profile changes are limited to 10/hour/identity.

Additive tables: forum_profiles, forum_threads, forum_posts, forum_reactions, with parent-thread validation and unique (user,post) reactions. Per identity: 5 threads/day, 6 replies/minute, 100 replies/day, 40 reactions/minute. Per network: 10 threads/day and 200 replies/day, plus the existing shared request/registration limits. Maximum 10,000 threads and 1,000 messages/thread; stored history is not silently deleted. The API request cap is 16 KiB; response cap remains 16 MiB.

Owner dashboard > Community forum moderation supports paged hidden/public review, hide/restore thread or post, close/reopen thread, block/unblock a post's author across voting and forum, and clear an inappropriate name/picture. Blocking prevents all community writes, including profile changes, and excludes reactions; posts remain until hidden. All moderation is owner-authenticated with CSRF/Origin checks and audited. forum-test.php exercises the lifecycle in a temporary database only. Deploy forum.php before the API requiring it; keep the private database and code backup outside the public directory.
## Administrator forum participation (2 November 2026)

The forum desk is first in the owner workspace, ahead of voting statistics, announcements and suggestions. Threads load automatically after login. Your administrator profile lets the owner save a display name and choose/remove a PNG/JPEG photo, converted in-browser into the existing bounded32×32 RGB representation before upload. Saving updates the identity on existing forum posts as well as future ones. No profile is set or message posted during deployment.

The dashboard can create threads, reply to threads or individual messages, and like/dislike/remove a reaction, alongside its moderation tools. Administrator messages carry the server-assigned Administrator member label, which the existing native client displays with the chosen name/picture. No DAW launch or app update is required for the owner to participate.

Owner participation routes run only behind admin.php's existing authenticated-session, CSRF and Origin gates. A distinct owner:community actor cannot be obtained via public anonymous tokens (their IDs are SHA256 hex). Client-supplied user IDs are ignored. Existing thread locks, visibility checks, limits and input validation still apply; use moderation controls to restore/reopen before replying to a hidden/closed thread. Administrator activity is audited. Owner profile creation is lazy, on an explicit save or post, so read-only deployment verification does not create a public identity.

## Change Log (2 November 2026)

Voting, Community Forum and Change Log are adjacent native browser sections. The changelog is bundled, searchable and available offline without voter registration. Its public history starts with the Michael Lane edition on 28 October 2026; it does not claim to cover earlier upstream development. Edit packaging/changelog.json for new public changes, then run python packaging/render-changelog.py to update the identical history on the download page. Keep private features out and distinguish development dates from published build milestones. Website deployment is separate from application release publication.

## Structured feedback inbox (3 November 2026)
The prominent app Report a bug button opens features/feedback.html with reviewable diagnostics in the URL fragment. Reports have dedicated statuses, optional private attachments, affected confirmations and followed-report updates. The owner dashboard now starts with a triage inbox and private JSON export. See FEEDBACK-WORKFLOW.md for assistant review, API contracts, privacy boundaries and source-post import. This is on-demand review tooling, not an autonomous monitor; no email notifications are configured. The existing voting and forum identities, posts and moderation remain intact.
